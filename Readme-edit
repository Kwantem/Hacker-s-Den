Working on this code for a game I want to call Hacker's Den. 
All suggestions and input is welcomed.
It is based on Python.
The goal is for this project to be open source. 
Everyone can have access to this game.

Hacker's Den is a world where you can test your skills in a virtual environment!!!!
This is a Hacker's playground!!!
Happy Hacking!!!
